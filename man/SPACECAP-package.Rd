\title{A Program to Estimate Animal Abundance and Density using Bayesian Spatially-Explicit Capture-Recapture Models}
\description{
    \pkg{SPACECAP} is a user-friendly software package for estimating animal 
    densities using closed model capture-recapture sampling based 
    on photographic captures using Bayesian spatially-explicit capture- 
    recapture models. This approach offers advantage such 
    as: substantially dealing with problems posed by individual 
    heterogeneity in capture probabilities in conventional 
    capture-recapture analyses. It also offers non-asymptotic 
    inferences which are more appropriate for small samples of 
    capture data typical of photo-capture studies.
